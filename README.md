##  About the Project
This project allows students, engineers, and mathematics enthusiasts to visually examine the behaviors of functions. Using Python's powerful libraries, it offers fast, accurate, and interactive graphs.

##  Key Features

* **Dynamic Function Plotting:** Supports mathematical expressions like `x**2`, `sin(x)`, `exp(x)`.
* **Interactive Graphs:** Features zooming, panning, and returning to the home view on graphs.
* **Customizable Ranges:** Ability to manually set start and end values for X and Y axes.
* **Saving Capability:** Ability to save generated graphs to your computer in PNG or other formats.
* **Error Management:** Warning mechanism to inform the user in case of incorrect function inputs.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

This project was developed with the following open-source Python libraries:

* **[Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/):** Main programming language.
* **[Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html):** Graphical User Interface (GUI).
* **[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/):** Data visualization and plotting engine.
* **[NumPy](https://numpy.org/):** High-performance mathematical computations.
